# Tic-Tac-Toe
Implemented a basic paper-pencil game using Java Language.

It is a 2 player mode game having board of 3 X 3 grid with either X's or O's.
1 player can select either X or O.
A player who succeeds placing his/her marks in vertical, horizontal or diagonal row wins.
If the board is filled without any wins leads to tie.
